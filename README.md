# SQL-Analysis

This repository contains SQL code which is run in Jupyter notebooks. The folder **DataCamp** consists of <a href="https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects">Datacamp projects</a> where one needs to use PostgreSQL to analyze various datasets. So far I've completed four of these exercises, which investigate international debt statistics, American baby names, test scores in the NYC public school system and video game reviews. In the future this repository will be updated with more examples where we will use Google's BigQuery to analyze other interesting datasets using SQL.
